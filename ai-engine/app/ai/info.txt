AI Module Directory Structure

This directory contains all AI-related implementations and abstractions.

Key Components:
1. llm/ - Language Model implementations and interfaces
2. embeddings/ - Text embedding and vector operations
3. tools/ - Tool calling implementations for LLMs
4. chains/ - LangChain/LangGraph based chain implementations

Best Practices:
- Keep provider-specific implementations separate
- Use abstract base classes for interfaces
- Implement factory patterns for provider selection
- Handle errors gracefully with custom exceptions
- Cache expensive operations where possible
- Use async operations for better performance

Future Considerations:
- Vector database integrations
- Multi-modal model support
- Custom tool implementations
- Advanced reasoning chains
- Agent implementations
