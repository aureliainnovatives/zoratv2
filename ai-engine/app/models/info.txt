Models Directory

Purpose:
Contains all database models and schemas for the application.

Components:
1. MongoDB Models:
   - LLM configurations
   - Chat histories
   - User sessions
   - Tool configurations
   - Vector store metadata

2. Pydantic Models:
   - Request/Response schemas
   - Configuration schemas
   - Validation models
   - Data transfer objects (DTOs)

Implementation Guidelines:
1. Use Pydantic for data validation
2. Implement proper type hints
3. Use enums for fixed choices
4. Include field descriptions and examples
5. Implement proper serialization methods
6. Use inheritance where appropriate
7. Include validation rules and custom validators

Best Practices:
- Keep models focused and single-responsibility
- Use composition over inheritance
- Include proper documentation
- Implement proper data sanitization
- Use proper field types and constraints
- Include example data
- Implement proper versioning

Schema Evolution:
- Handle backward compatibility
- Include migration strategies
- Version critical models
- Document breaking changes
